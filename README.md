# radicle-decisions

**Radicle Developers of All Countries, Unite!**

## What is this?

`radicle-decisions` is the home for our proposed decisions that have been
scrutinised by our team of developers.
_Accepted decisions_ are expected to be adhered to and practised throughout the
`radicle-dev` organisation.
_Rejected decisions_ will be be left as a trace to what we have proposed and why
it was ultimately rejected.

## Proposals

### Requirements

The proposal process is meant to drive cross-cutting engineering improvements
across Radicle. We want the bar for a proposal to be as low as possible - to
encourage positive change and alginment among engineers. Therefore we see any
proposal as valid as long as an engineer inside of Radicle sees the need to
formalise or decide on a certain aspect on development. It can, but doesn't
need to be, originate from a discussion on
[radicle.community](https://radicle.community). A discussion should be lifted
into a proposal when enough added benefit has surfaced.

### Common decision to capture

* programming techniques
* architecture changes/patterns
* tools and dependency recommendations
* ecosystem

### Process
* Open a PR with a new proposal copied from the [template]()
* Assign yourself - as the assignee is in charge of seeing the proposal through
* Request `radicle-dev/engineering` as reviewers
* Announce new proposal in the [development
  section](https://radicle.community/c/development-discussion/9)
* Keep the conversation in the PR to not loose information
* Incorporate feedback
* Get quorum for approval
