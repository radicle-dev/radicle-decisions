## Error Handling

As good Rust developers we persevere to provide good error handling. This is a nuanced statement as
it may cover library errors, command line errors, structured recoverable errors, unstructured
recoverable errors, and unrecoverable errors. This proposal will examine and contrast the different
methods and libraries that exist, ultimately making a decision as to which methods and library(ies)
our Rust developers should use when writing our libraries and applications.

## The std

// Talk about Option and Result
// Talk about Error trait

## Types of Errors

// Talk about String
// Talk about enums

## High Level View

// List the libraries in a table
✔️: Is supported by the library
❌: Is not supported by the library
