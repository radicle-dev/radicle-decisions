# Motivation

Create a more inclusive environment in our collaboration artefacts and end-user
software by adopting a default branch name that is neutral and without negative
conotation.

# Explanation

As the repositories we collaborate on and the software we build is our main avenue to shape our
environment, we should be sensitive to the meaning and weight certain
terminology carries. While most of us might not be in the position to judge
what weight these words carry, we can avoid it impacting or excluding
a potential collaborator or user.

# Recommendation

* adopt `main` as the default branch name in our application and the network
  protocols
* rename all mainline branches in our repositories with `main`

# Drawbacks

* it will require some administration on our code hosting platform
* local checkouts have to be adjusted

# Open Questions

* Can we think of potential alternatives to `main` (e.g. `trunk`)?

# Future possibilities

* A more safe environment for more
